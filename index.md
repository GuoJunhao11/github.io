### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    Part 1 of lab 11 was a program that read a CSV file and stored all elements from the file into a 2d vector by using object-oriented programming. It was a challenge for me at the beginning because it required some programming knowledge to handle each line of file. During the lab study, I was able to to do some debugging for each function and wrote a complete program.

* Lab 8

    Part 2 of Lab 8 was a C++ program that checks if a number is prime or not. I was confused about what a prime number was at the beginning. During the lab study, I was able to know the definition of prime numbers and write a function to search all possible numbers effectively by using an algorithm

* Lab 9

    Part 1 of lab 9 was a program that guessing games with numbers in separate files. It was an updated version from a previous lab assignment. I like this program because it allows two people to play without knowing the number. After the lab, I was able to play with my friend with this game I created.
