### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    Part 1 of Lab 11 was a program that read a CSV file and stored all elements from the file into a 2D vector using object-oriented programming. At first, it was challenging for me as it required programming knowledge to handle each line of the file. However, during the lab study, I was able to debug each function and write a complete program.

* Lab 8

    Part 2 of Lab 8 was a C++ program that checks whether a number is prime or not. I was initially confused about what a prime number was, but during the lab study, I was able to understand its definition and write a function to effectively search all possible numbers using an algorithm.

* Lab 9

    Part 1 of Lab 9 was an updated version of a previous lab assignment, which was a program for guessing games with numbers in separate files. I particularly enjoyed this program because it allows two people to play without knowing the number. After the lab, I was able to play the game with my friend using the program I created.
